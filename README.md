# Shifupi

Shifupi is a 3D-printed robotic hand controlled by a Raspberry Pi to play Rock-Paper-Scissors. 
It has a camera connected to a hand-mand AI to detect which symbol the player played and therefore determine who won.
For now I still have to improve the structure but it's working just fine ^^
